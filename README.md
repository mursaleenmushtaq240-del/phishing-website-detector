# 🛡️ Phishing Website Detector

This project is developed by *Mursaleen Mushtaq* as a learning project for understanding how *machine learning* can be used to detect *phishing websites* based on URL features and security indicators.

---

## 📖 Project Overview
The *Phishing Website Detector* is a simple Flask-based web app that predicts whether a website is Safe or Phishing.  
It uses machine learning algorithms to analyze different URL and domain features (like HTTPS presence, length, special symbols, and digits) and classify the site accordingly.
