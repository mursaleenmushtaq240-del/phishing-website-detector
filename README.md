## üîç How It Works
The program checks the following:
- Missing HTTPS  
- Use of special symbols like @  
- Suspicious words (like login, verify, secure, etc.)  
- Very long or strange domain names  
- Use of hyphens or numbers in the domain  

Each point adds to a ‚Äúrisk score,‚Äù and finally, the program decides if the link is Safe, Suspicious, or Risky.
